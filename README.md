# QR Shorter

URL shortener + QR code generator with redirect/QR statistics and light/dark mode.

## Features

- Shorten long links into unique codes.
- Redirect by visiting `/{code}`.
- Generate QR code for each short URL (`/api/qr/{code}`).
- Track redirect counts and QR scan counts.
- Show stats in the UI and API (`/api/stats/{code}`).
- Light and dark mode toggle.

## Storage

- **Local development**: SQLite file (default: `data/qr-shorter.db`).
- **Vercel / persistent deployment**: Upstash Redis via env vars:
  - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
  - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`

If Redis variables are present, Redis is used automatically.  
If not, SQLite is used.

## Base URL on Vercel

Generated short URLs and QR destinations use this priority:

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` (recommended for custom domains)
2. `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL`
3. `VERCEL_URL`
4. Request host headers / localhost fallback

Setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` helps avoid links pointing to temporary preview deployment URLs.

## SEO setup

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the canonical production domain so metadata, JSON-LD, robots.txt, and sitemap URLs resolve correctly.
- The app emits site-wide Schema.org `WebSite` JSON-LD, Open Graph, Twitter Card metadata, and a canonical title template.
- The following paths are blocked from indexing through metadata and `X-Robots-Tag` headers: `/api/*`, `/stats/*`, and `/redirect/*`.
- Run `npm run build` after deploying to confirm the generated metadata routes (`/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml`) compile cleanly.
